Hi there <%= scholar.name.split(/\s+/).first %>!

Are you psyched for RailsConf tomorrow? Me too! We’ve fed all the Guide and Scholar names into the RailsConf Scholar Matcher machine(tm), and I think you're going to like what came out.
<% if other_guide.nil? %>
Tonight at 5:30 in the Fountainview room at the Sheraton, we're getting all the guides and scholars together to meet. We’ll be introducing you to your guide, <%= guide.name %>. When you get there, come find me or Abby Phoenix, and we'll get you together with the right person.

Tonight at 5:30 in the Fountainview room at the Sheraton, we're getting all the guides and scholars together to meet. We’ll be introducing you to your 2(!) guides, <%= guide.name %> and <%= other_guide.name %>. When you get there, come find me or Abby Phoenix, and we'll get you together with the right people.
<% end %>
To get there: the Fountainview Room is located on the lobby level, on the river side of the hotel. The Sheraton site has directions to the hotel itself: http://www.sheratonchicago.com/faqs/transportationparking.html.

I'm excited to see you tonight & throughout the conference this week! Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah
